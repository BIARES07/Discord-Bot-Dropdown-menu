## Discord Bot | Dropdown menu

This bot was developed specifically for a Discord server with the purpose of providing members with price lists for various services 
(in this case, services related to an MMO). Users can interact with dropdown menus to select a category, 
prompting the bot to send a message containing the relevant price list.

## final notes

* Currently this bot has 6 commands (4 to build the menu, 1 additional one and a slash command)

* This was the first bot I developed, so it doesn't follow the best development techniques.

* This bot was made in an old version of python (3.8.7) library so I'm leaving this project as *outdated*
